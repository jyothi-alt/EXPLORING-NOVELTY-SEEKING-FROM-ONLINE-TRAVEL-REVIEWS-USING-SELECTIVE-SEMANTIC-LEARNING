# **EXPLORING-NOVELTY-SEEKING-FROM-ONLINE-TRAVEL-REVIEWS-USING-SELECTIVE-SEMANTIC-LEARNING**
*Travel online reviews is important experience related information for understanding an inherent
personality trait, novelty seeking (NS), which influences tourism motivation and the choice of tourism
destinations. Manual classification of these reviews is challenging due to their high volume and unstructured
nature. This paper aims to develop a classification framework and deep learning model to overcome these
limitations.*

#**Key Features:**

*Novelty-Seeking Insights: Identifies how NS traits drive tourism behaviors and preferences through travel reviews.
Selective Semantic Learning: Employs advanced semantic techniques to capture nuanced meanings in reviews, focusing on NS indicators.
Deep Learning Model: Implements state-of-the-art neural networks for automated review classification and analysis.
Handling Unstructured Data: Addresses the high volume and variability in reviews using text preprocessing and advanced natural language processing (NLP).*

#**Pre-Requisites**
*NLP, Deep Learning, ML basics.
Python, pandas, NumPy.
Tourism domain insights.*

#**Technologies Used**
*Languages/Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook.
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face.
Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, BERT.*
